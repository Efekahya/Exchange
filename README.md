## TODO List

### Middlewares

- [] Create a global error handler to capture uncaught exceptions
- [] Create a utility function to handle errors instead of having to write try/catch blocks and if statements everywhere

### Models

- [] Set up getters and setters for each models to prevent redundant code

### TS

- [] Maybe use a different ORM that supports TS better or find a better way to infer types

### Tests

- [] Domain testing for all the endpoints
